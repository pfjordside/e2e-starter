# e2e-starter

Template repo for e2e tests using Playwright

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx install playwright
   ```

2. **Define test users**:

   - The test users are defined in `playwright/config/test-users.const.ts`:

     ```ts
     export const testUser: TestUser = {
       username: 'test_user',
       password: 'TEST_USER_PASSWORD',
     };

     export const admin: TestUser = {
       username: 'admin',
       password: 'ADMIN_PASSWORD',
     };
     ```

### Running Tests

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to set up the base URL and test user passwords if not already configured.
2. Execute the Playwright tests.

To run the tests in headed mode (with a browser UI), use:

```bash
npm run e2e:headed
```

### Additional Information

- Test results are saved in `test-results/test-results.xml`.
- Authentication states are stored in `playwright/.auth/`.

Happy testing! ðŸ§ªðŸ¥³
